# *Tools.Olin* Project Proposal
Jack Greenberg

*A redesign and backend-restructuring of tools.olin.edu to include ability to sign up for trainings and better manage user-tool authorizations.*

## MVP
- A front-end that allows students to...
  - ...see the tools they are trained on
  - ...sign up for trainings
  - ...request training times
- A back-end that allows NINJA’s and shop staff to…
  - ...create trainings for a specific time and tool
  - ...cancel/modify trainings
- A back-end that allows shop staff to…
  - ...create new training types
  - ...add new tools
  - ...update training types
- Accessibility, Speed

## Nice to have
- Email/Slack/SMS Notifications
- Onboarding for first-time users

## Overview
Phase|Time|Deliverables
---|---|---
1 - *Research*|2 weeks|Updated list of requirements surveyed from shop staff, NINJAs, and students
2 - *Back-end Architecture*|4 weeks|SQL database, data processing, site routing and request processing
3 - *Front-end Design*|4 weeks|Figma/Illustrator/InDesign files showcasing the design of the site
4 - *Front-end Development*|3 weeks|Final site complete for review
5 - *Launch*|1 day|Training for staff, NINJAs, and students

## Phase 1 - *Research*
Before diving head-first into any development, we should survey the actual users to find out what their needs are, and how they are best met. We should consider ease-of-use and functionality of the future site, as well as both advantages and pain-points of the current site.
